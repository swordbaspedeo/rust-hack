## ⚙️ Configuration and How It Works

The **Rust ESP** works by injecting a custom code into the game’s memory, allowing you to see players, items, and other important objects through walls. You can adjust its behavior via the settings file or built-in interface:

- **ESP Toggle**: Toggle on/off the ability to see players, loot, and resources through walls.
- **Display Style**: Customize the color, transparency, and display options of ESP information.
- **Player ESP**: Choose whether to show player names, health, distance, and team affiliation.
- **Item/Resource ESP**: Select what types of items or resources you want to highlight in your game.
- **Hotkeys**: Set custom hotkeys to toggle ESP features or activate other cheat functions on the fly.

### How it works:
1. The cheat runs in the background while Rust is open, injecting custom code into the game’s memory.
2. It tracks the position of players, loot, and resources in the game world and renders them to the screen in real-time.
3. The cheat dynamically updates ESP information based on the game state, and you can toggle features as needed.
